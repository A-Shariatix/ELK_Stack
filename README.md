## Overview
This project is a demo implementation of a system that aggregates, stores, and visualizes logs and metrics. The Docker Compose deployment provides Elasticsearch for storage, Kibana for visualization, and a Fleet server cluster consisting of three nodes to manage Elastic Agents. There is also an Elastic agent defined within the Docker Compose file to collect data from a Linux server. See the below description for more details.
